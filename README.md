## About

Meteorite strikes have always fascinated humanity, offering glimpses into the cosmos and the mysteries of our universe. This web application leverages the NASA dataset containing information about more than 45,000 meteorite strikes. It empowers users to explore this data in novel ways, including data summarization, customized data analysis, and interactive visualizations.

## API

We rely on the [NASA Meteorite Landings API](https://data.nasa.gov/), which provides comprehensive data on meteorite strikes worldwide. This API serves as the backbone of our application, enabling us to access and present meteorite strike data effectively.

## Technologies

The Meteorite Strikes Explorer is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building server-rendered React applications.
- **CSS Modules**: A CSS approach that scopes styles to the component level, preventing style conflicts.
- **Typescript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **Chart.js**: A JavaScript charting library that enables us to create interactive and visually appealing data visualizations.
